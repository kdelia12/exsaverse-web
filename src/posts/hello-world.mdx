## How it all started

In 2020, when the crypto market was booming, We was looking for a way to learn more about the space. We was already following a few crypto-related subreddits, but Wewanted to find a place where Wecould learn more about the space and interact with others who were interested in it. Wefound a few communities, but they were either too small or too focused on a specific topic.
